      " Thank you for asking! The sky appears blue because of the way light scatters in the Earth's atmosphere. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules absorb and scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its characteristic blue color. The exact shade of blue can vary depending on the time of day and the amount of dust and pollutants in the air, but the basic principle of Rayleigh scattering explains why the sky appears blue to our eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that the sky can appear different colors under different conditions. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the angle of the sunlight and the scattering of light by atmospheric particles. Additionally, pollution and dust can also affect the color of the sky, making it appear more hazy or yellowish.\n",
